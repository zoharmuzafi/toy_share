#ToyBin

## Introduction

The app allows the users to upload their old toys and offer them to the community. The users can choose any desired toy from the ones available in the bin using various search filters. Users can login to the app and manage their profile. A profile can be created using either Facebook auth or by email (the app wasn’t approved by facebook and Fb connection might not be available). Users can also upload toys and menage them (edit/delete/make available or unavailable), menage their own profile including upload a profile picture, edit/delete their profile, and connect with other users using the inbox.

##Future Steps

We understand that Toy Bin is a work in progress and we hope we can add the following additions in the future: 

*	Further optimize the search engine so it works better for a variety of categories. 
*	Improve the overall user experience. 
*	Build out the inventory page to be more dynamic, so that members can easily browse for items
*	Have a better theme layout and color choices
*	Have chats page click into particular chats in the inbox
*	Register on Facebook and make it live. Also add more external API’s, such as Twitter or Github 
*	Test the entire application, so that all features are measured
